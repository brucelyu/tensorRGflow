@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="This is because the pieces of low-rank matrices and the isometric tensors in the RG equation of the GILT-HOTRG in Eq.~\protect \textup  {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \protect \normalfont  (\ignorespaces \ref {def:RGeqGiltHOTRG}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}} will inherit the reflection symmetry of the input tensor $A$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="In principle, we can choose $\chi = 30$ here. In practice, however, our calculations show that the problem of local correlations in the HOTRG becomes worse at larger bond dimensions (see Ref.~\cite {Berker2008} for a similar observation in the context of the TRG), and that $\chi = 12$ is enough to demonstrate this problem."}
