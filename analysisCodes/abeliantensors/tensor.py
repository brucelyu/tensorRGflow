        The optional argument `chis` is a list of bond dimensions. The SVD is
        truncated to one of these dimensions `chi`, meaning that only `chi`
        largest singular values are kept. If `chis` is a single integer (either
        within a singleton list or just as a bare integer) this dimension is
        used. If ``eps == 0``, the largest value in `chis` is used. Otherwise
        the smallest `chi` in `chis` is used, such that the relative error made
        in the truncation is smaller than `eps`. The truncation error is by
        default the Frobenius norm of the difference, but can be specified with
        the keyword agument `trunc_err_func`.

        An exception to the above is made by degenerate singular values. By
        default truncation is never done so that some singular values are
        included while others of the same value are left out. If this is about
        to happen, `chi` is decreased so that none of the degenerate singular
        values are included. This default behavior can be changed with the
        keyword argument `break_degenerate`. The default threshold for when
        singular values are considered degenerate is 1e-6. This can be changed
        with the keyword argument `degeneracy_eps`.

        If `sparse` is True, a sparse SVD, using power methods from
        `scipy.sparse.svds`, is used. This SVD is done to find ``max(chis)``
        singular values, after which the decomposition may be truncated further
        if the truncation error so allows. Thus ``max(chis)`` should be much
        smaller than the full size of the matrix, if `sparse` is True.

        The return value is``U, S, V, rel_err``, where `S` is a vector and `U`
        and `V` are unitary matrices. They are such that ``U.diag(S).V ==
        self``, where the equality is appromixate if there is truncation.
        `rel_err` is the truncation error.
