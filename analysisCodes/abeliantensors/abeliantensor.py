class AbelianTensor(TensorCommon):
    """A class for symmetry preserving tensors capabable of handling abelian
    symmetry groups.

    This class is meant to be subclassed to implement specific symmetries,
    which can typically be done by simply fixing the `qodulus` of the class
    (see below).

    Every `AbelianTensor` has the following attributes:

    `shape`: A list of `dims`, one `dim` per index. Every `dim` is a list of
    integerers that are the dimensions of the different quantum number blocks
    along that indices.

    `qhape`: A list of `qims`, one `qim` per index. Every `qim` is a list of
    unique integers that are the quantum numbers (`qnums`), aka charges, of
    that index. The quantum numbers are in one-to-one correspondence with the
    elements of the `dims`, so that ``qhape[i][j]`` and ``shape[i][j]`` are the
    `qnum` and dimension of the same block.

    `dirs`: A list of integers -1 or 1, one for each index. 1 means that the
    corresponding index is outgoing, -1 means incoming.

    `qodulus`: An integer or None. If an integer, then all arithmetic on the
    quantum numbers is done modulo `qodulus`. If None then arithmetic on
    `qnums` is just usual integer arithmetic.

    `sects`: A dict of numpy arrays, with combinations of quantum numbers as
    keys. Every key must a tuple of quantum numbers, one for each index, and
    each one of them being from the `qim` of that index. The value of the dict
    at this key is the block (or "sector" or "sect") corresponding to these
    quantum numbers. If the tensor is invariant under a symmetry (see `invar`)
    then only certain blocks are allowed to be set, but even in such a cause
    not all allowed blocks must be set. For the treatement of unset blocks see
    `defval`.

    `dtype`: A NumPy dtype, that is the dtype of all the sects.

    `defval`: The default value that the tensor has everywhere outside the
    blocks set in `sects`. If the tensor is a scalar with no indices then its
    value is its `defval` and it has no blocks. Note that many of the methods -
    such as `dot` and `svd` - require ``defval == 0`` (and assert this). The
    main use of ``defval != 0`` is to be able to handle tensors of boolean
    values that arise in comparisons.

    `charge`: An integer such that if `invar` is True then all the blocks set
    in `sects` must have keys `k` such that ``sum_i k[i]*dirs[i] % qodulus ==
    charge``.

    `invar`: A boolean. If True, then the tensor is invariant under the
    symmetry determined by `qodulus`, in the sense described in the definition
    of `charge`.  If False, this condition is ignored and any block can be set.
    Note that as with `defval`, many methods require the tensor to be invariant
    and ``invar == False`` is mainly used for handling vectors of singular
    values and eigenvalues. If ``invar == True`` then `defval` must be 0,
    unless the tensor is a scalar of `charge` 0.

    Note that many of these rules are not constantly checked for and can be
    broken by the user. In such cases behavior of the class is not guaranteed.
    The method `check_consistency` can be used to check that the tensor
    conforms to this definition.

        `indices` is an iterable of indices to be split. `dims` is an iterable
        such that ``dim_batch=dims[i]`` is an iterable of lists of dimensions,
        each list giving the dimensions along a new index that will come out of
        splitting ``indices[i]``. `qims` correspondingly gives the `qims` of
        the new indices, and `dirs` gives the new directions.

        An example clarifies:
        Suppose `self` has `shape` ``[dim1, dim2, dim3, dim4]``, `qhape`
        ``[qim1, qim2, qim3, qim4]``, and `dirs` ``[d1,d2,d3,d4]``. Suppose
        then that ``indices = [1,3]``, ``dims = [[dimA, dimB], [dimC, dimD]]``,
        ``qims = [[qimA, qimB], [qimC, qimD]]`` and ``dirs = [[dA, dB] [dC,
        dD]]``.  Then the resulting tensor will have `shape` ``[dim1, dimA,
        dimB, dim3, dimC, dimD]``, `qhape` ``[qim1, qimA, qimB, qim3, qimC,
        qimD]``, and `dirs` ``[d1, dA, dB, d3, dC, dD]``.  All this assuming
        that that `dims` and `qims` are such that joining `qimA` and `qimB`
        gives `qim2`, etc.

        Instead of a list of indices a single index may be given.
        Correspondingly `dims`, `qims` and `dirs` should then have one level of
        depth less as well.

        the matrix, if `sparse` is True.

        """Singular value decompose a matrix.

        The matrix must have ``invar == True`` and ``defval == 0``.

        The optional argument `chis` is a list of bond dimensions. The SVD is
        truncated to one of these dimensions `chi`, meaning that only `chi`
        largest singular values are kept. If `chis` is a single integer (either
        within a singleton list or just as a bare integer) this dimension is
        used. If ``eps == 0``, the largest value in `chis` is used. Otherwise
        the smallest `chi` in `chis` is used, such that the relative error made
        in the truncation is smaller than `eps`. The truncation error is by
        default the Frobenius norm of the difference, but can be specified with
        the keyword agument `trunc_err_func`.

        An exception to the above is made by degenerate singular values. By
        default truncation is never done so that some singular values are
        included while others of the same value are left out. If this is about
        to happen, `chi` is decreased so that none of the degenerate singular
        values are included. This default behavior can be changed with the
        keyword argument `break_degenerate`. The default threshold for when
        singular values are considered degenerate is 1e-6. This can be changed
        with the keyword argument `degeneracy_eps`.

        If `sparse` is True, a sparse SVD, using power methods from
        `scipy.sparse.svds`, is used. This SVD is done to find ``max(chis)``
        singular values, after which the decomposition may be truncated further
        if the truncation error so allows. Thus ``max(chis)`` should be much
        smaller than the full size of the matrix, if `sparse` is True.

        The method returns the tuple ``U, S, V, rel_err``, where `S` is a
        non-invariant vector and `U` and `V` are unitary matrices. They are
        such that ``U.diag(S).V == self``, where the equality is appromixate if
        there is truncation. `U` and `S` have always charge 0, but `V` has the
        same charge as `self`. `U` has `dirs` ``[d, -d]`` where ``d =
        self.dirs[0]``, but `V` has the same `dirs` as `self`. `rel_err` is the
        truncation error.
