# Canonical RG prescription in tensor space using the GILT-HOTRG
This repository keeps the latex files of the arXiv e-print, [*Scaling dimensions from linearized tensor renormalization group transformations*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08136), and the Python3 codes of the numerical calculations in the e-print, including the implementation of the [graph independent local truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07460) (GILT) and the [higer-order tensor renormalization group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1144) (HOTRG).

Apart from the standard computational libraries like NumPy and SciPy, the implementation here relies heavily on three other libraries: [tn-tools](https://github.com/mhauru/tntools), [ncon](https://github.com/mhauru/ncon) and [abeliantensors](https://github.com/mhauru/abeliantensors), all implemented by Markus Hauru.

## Requirements
* [Anaconda packages](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), specifically NumPy and SciPy
* [google/jax](https://github.com/google/jax) library, an extension of NumPy to support automatic differentiation
* [tn-tools](https://github.com/mhauru/tntools) and [ncon](https://github.com/mhauru/ncon)
* Installation of [abeliantensors](https://github.com/mhauru/abeliantensors) is not necessary, since I've made small adjustments to this package and copied it here.

## File descriptions
All the Python3 codes of the numerical calulations for the 2D Ising model reported in the e-print are located in the `analysisCodes` directory.
The calculations for the 1D Ising model are located in `misc` directory.
All the remaining things are latex files of the e-print.
We give a detailed explanation of the Python3 codes in the `analysisCodes` directory.

## Inside `analysisCodes` directory
### `abeliantensors` directory
This is a package copied directly from the [abeliantensors](https://github.com/mhauru/abeliantensors) repository, with small adjustments to the `abeliantensors/abeliantensor.py` file to make the tensor RG flow more stable. The adjustments involve the `matrix_eig` function starting from line 1885. We add a boolean argument `evenTrunc` for this function. If `evenTrunc = True`, the bond dimension will be distributed evenly among two different sectors of a Z2 symmetric tensor.

### Functions
* `jncon.py`— It is the jax version of `ncon` function for tensor contractions. It is based on the `ncon` function provided in Evenbly's [tensor network tutorial website](https://www.tensors.net/code). Basically, we replace NumPy matrix multiplications with the corresponding jax version. It will be useful when we linearize the RG equation of GILT-HOTRG to generate the linearized RG equation in Eq. (55) in the e-print.
* `Isings.py`— Contain a function, `Ising2dT`, to generate the initial tensor for the 2D Ising model, using the [tn-tools](https://github.com/mhauru/tntools) library.
* `gilts.py`— Implementation of the [graph independent local truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07460). I follow [Markus Hauru's implementation of the GILT](https://github.com/Gilt-TNR/Gilt-TNR) closely. Besides, I also implement Evenbly's [full environment truncation (FET)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05390) here. I tried both the FET and GILT during the development phase of this research project, and my computations suggested that the GILT suits the purpose of this e-print better.
* `HOTRG.py`— Implementation of the HOTRG, armed with the GILT and the sign fixing switches. Specifically, the function `normFlowHOTRG` generates tensor RG flows using the RG equation of the GILT-HOTRG implemented in the function `oneHOTRG`. The function `fixBestSign` fixes the sign ambiguity of the fixed-point tensor. The function `diffGiltHOTRG` uses the automatical differentiation in the JAX library to linearize the RG equation of the GILT-HOTRG, and calculates the scaling dimensions from the eigenvalues of the linearized RG equation.
### Scripts for analysis
* `hotrgTc.py`— Analyze the flow of the tensor norm, and use bisection method to determine the approximated critical temeprature Tc. Save the estimated Tc to the disk.
* `hotrgFlow.py`— Generate tensor RG flows right at the estimated critical temperature Tc. Save the critical fixed-point tensor A, the corresponding pieces of Q matrices and isometries w and v at each RG step to the disk.
* `hotrgScale.py`— Use the flow of the tensors generated by `hotrgFlow.py` to build the linearized RG equation at the critical fixed point. Use `diffGiltHOTRG` function to calculated scaling dimensions and save them to the disk.

### Plot the data
* `drawRGflow.py`— Draw tensor RG flows.
* `drawScD.py` — Print out and draw scaling dimensions at various RG steps.

## Perform the computations
First of all, make sure you have installed all the required packages in the [requirements section](#requirements). To set up the environment, first install anaconda; then run the following commands in your terminal: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/brucelyu/tensorRGflow.git
cd tensorRGflow/analysisCodes
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```
Let's say we want to perform the computation using a maximal bond dimension 20. We first estimate the critical temperature by running
```shell
python hotrgTc.py --chi 20 --isGilt --isSym --Ngilt 2 --legcut 2 --gilteps 6e-5 --maxiter 31 --rootiter 12 --Thi 1.001 --Tlow 0.9989
```
The estimated critical temperature will be saved as `tensorRGflow/out/eps6e-05_chi20/Tc.pkl`. In the second step, we generate a tensor RG flow right at this estimated critlca temperature by running
```shell
python hotrgFlow.py --chi 20 --Ngilt 2 --legcut 2 --gilteps 6e-5 --maxiter 31
```
The tensors at each RG step will be save to `tensorRGflow/analysisCodes/data` directory and `tensorRGflow/out` directory. To plot various tensor RG flows, run
```shell
python drawRGflow.py --chi 20 --isGilt --gilteps 6e-5 --scheme Gilt-HOTRG --Ngilt 2 --legcut 2
```
All figures will be save to `tensorRGflow/out/eps6e-05_chi20` directory. Finally, we can linearze the RG equation of the GILT-HOTRG to calcuate scaling dimensions
```shell
python hotrgScale.py --chi 20 --gilteps 6e-5 --Ngilt 2 --legcut 2 --iRGlow 5 --iRGhi 21
```
Draw the estimated scaling dimensions at different RG steps by running
```shell
python drawScD.py --chi 20 --gilteps 6e-5 --Ngilt 2 --legcut 2
```
Again, the figure will be save to `tensorRGflow/analysisCodes/data` directory.
