# Canonical RG prescription in tensor space using the GILT-HOTRG
This repository keeps the latex files of the arXiv e-print, [*Scaling dimensions from linearized tensor renormalization group transformations*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08136), and the Python3 codes of the numerical calculations in the e-print, including the implementation of the [graph independent local truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07460) (GILT) and the [higer-order tensor renormalization group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1144) (HOTRG).

Apart from the standard computational libraries like NumPy and SciPy, the implementation here relies heavily on three: libraries [tn-tools](https://github.com/mhauru/tntools), [ncon](https://github.com/mhauru/ncon) and [abeliantensors](https://github.com/mhauru/abeliantensors), all written by Markus Hauru.

## Requirements
* [Anaconda packages](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), specifically NumPy and SciPy
* [google/jax](https://github.com/google/jax) library which is an extension of numpy to support automatic differentiation
* [tn-tools](https://github.com/mhauru/tntools) and [ncon](https://github.com/mhauru/ncon)
* Installation of [abeliantensors](https://github.com/mhauru/abeliantensors) is not necessary, since I've made small adjustments to this package and copied it here.

## File descriptions
All the Python3 codes of the numerical calulations for the 2D Ising model reported in the e-print are located in the `analysisCodes` directory.
The calculations for the 1D Ising model are located in `misc` directory.
All the remaining things are latex files of the e-print.
We give a detailed explanation of the Python3 codes in the `analysisCodes` directory.

## Inside `analysisCodes` directory
### `abeliantensors` directory
It is the package copied directly from the [abeliantensors](https://github.com/mhauru/abeliantensors) repository, with small adjustments to the `abeliantensors/abeliantensor.py` file to make the tensor RG flow more stable. The adjustments involve the `matrix_eig` function starting from line 1885. We add a boolean argument `evenTrunc` for this function. If `evenTrunc = True`, the bond dimension will be distributed evenly among two different sectors of a Z2 symmetric tensor.

### Functions
* `jncon.py`— It is the jax version of `ncon` function for tensor contractions. Basically, we replace NumPy matrix multiplications with the corresponding jax version. It will be useful when we linearize the RG equation of GILT-HOTRG to generate Eq. (55) in the e-print.
* `Isings.py`— Contain a function, `Ising2dT`, to generate the initial tensor for the 2D Ising model.
* `gilts.py`— Implementation of the [graph independent local truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07460). I follow [Markus Hauru's implementation of the GILT](https://github.com/Gilt-TNR/Gilt-TNR) very closely. Besides, I also implement Evenbly's [full environment truncation (FET)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05390) here. I tried both the FET and GILT in during the computation, and my computations suggest the GILT suits the purpose of this e-print better.
* `HOTRG.py`— Implementation of the HOTRG, armed with the GILT and the sign fixing switches. Specifically, the function `normFlowHOTRG` generates tensor RG flows using the RG equation of the GILT-HOTRG implemented in the function `oneHOTRG`. The function `fixBestSign` fixes the sign ambiguity of the fixed-point tensor. The function `diffGiltHOTRG` uses the automatical differentiation in the JAX library to linearize the RG equation of the GILT-HOTRG, and calculates the scaling dimensions from the eigenvalues of the linearized RG equation.
### Scripts for analysis
* `hotrgTc.py`— Analyze the flow of the tensor norm, and use bisection method to determine the approximated critical temeprature Tc. Save the estimated Tc to the disk.
* `hotrgFlow.py`— Generate tensor RG flows right at the estimated critical temperature Tc. Save the critical fixed-point tensor A, the corresponding pieces of Q matrices and isometries w and v at each RG step to the disk.
* `hotrgScale.py`— Use the flow of the tensors generated by `hotrgFlow.py` to build the linearized RG equation at the critical fixed point. Use `diffGiltHOTRG` function to calculated scaling dimensions and save them to the disk.
### Plot the data
* `drawRGflow.py`— Draw tensor RG flows.
* `drawScD.py` — Print out and draw scaling dimensions at various RG steps.
