# Canonical RG prescription in tensor space using the GILT-HOTRG
This repository keeps Python3 codes of the numerical calculations described in the arXiv e-print, [*Scaling dimensions from linearized tensor renormalization group transformations*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08136), including the implementation of the [graph independent local truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07460) (GILT) and the [higer-order tensor renormalization group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1144) (HOTRG).
