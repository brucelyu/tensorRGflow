My paper on response analysis in tensor space
## TODOS
- [ ] Finish the thrid remark in `Ising Model in 2D` section.
- [ ] Rewrite the gauge redundancy section to define it using orthogonal matrices and provide justifications.
- [ ] Generate new beautiful data figures in the last section (Make my Gilt-HOTRG code clear and publishable along the way).
- [ ] Finish ACKNOWLEDGMENTS and three appendices.
